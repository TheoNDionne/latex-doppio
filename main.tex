    \section{Introduction}
    \subsection{Hello}
    Hi mommy!

    \begin{equation}
        \frac{\text{d}f}{\mathrm{d}t} = \lim_{\Delta t\to0} \frac{f(t+\Delta t) - f(t)}{\Delta t}
    \end{equation}

    How a about a citation rn \cite{Edelsbrunner02}. And also:
    \begin{equation}
        \int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,\text{d}x = F(b) - F(a)
    \end{equation}

    Let's test the texjam macros, how about the Schrodinger equation:
    \al{\boxed{
        i\hbar\ddp{t}\ket{\psi} = \op{H}\ket{\psi}
    }}
    Ok seems to work

    How about
    \al{
        \boldsymbol{\sigma}_x = \pmat{0&1\\1&0}
    }
